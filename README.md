# PIG DICE GAME

### By wesley Mbate

## Description

 This is a fun easy to learn game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die or sometimes two. The Objective is being the first player to score 100 or more points.Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn't roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.
 If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.
 The website is one page only with a relaxing easy GUI, fun Hover effects and easy code to read, understand and debug.
